 June 2013 to April 2014: Design for an optical computer using thermochromatic thin films

In high school I became fascinated with the operation of logic gates, and wanted to 
build a basic adder circuit, but in a new and innovative way. From my chemistry 
experience, I had learned about the metamaterial Vanadium Dioxide and it's 
thermo-chromatic triggering properties. By following the manufacturing procedure 
outlined in [Deki, Aoi, & Kajinami's paper](https://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1018603402586), I designed a set of optical logic gates using the Vanadium Dioxide thin films that 
would produce binary levels of infrared light. This infrared light needed to be 
powerful enough to heat these Vi-O<sub>2</sub> thin films, so I set about constructing 
a flowing-air Carbon Dioxide laser. I was able to obtain several initial lases with 
this resonator, but eventually retired this project due to the difficulty of keeping a 
low vacuum, dangers of working with high voltage, and shear impracticability of it.
