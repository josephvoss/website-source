  May to November 2019:
  Coached a team for the Student Cluster Competition 2019

---

Several of my colleagues at Oak Ridge National Labs (including myself) got
involved in high performance computing through the Student Cluster Competition.
More about the competition can be found
[at the competition website](https://www.studentclustercompetition.us/) or in
the [post I wrote]({{< ref "/post/student-cluster-competition" >}}) earlier when I
competed, but essentially it challenges undergraduate students to design, build,
and manage a small HPC cluster to run a set of scientific applications quickly
and efficiently. This competition does a fantastic job of getting students
involved in scientific computing and system engineering, and as such one of my
coworkers wanted to host a team for 2019.

At the start of the summer we selected a team of students from local
universities to compete. We then worked with them for the next several months to
teach them how to submit jobs, compile and profile scientific code, manage a
diskless cluster, and several other HPC fundamentals. Additionally we were able
to teach them a lot about large scale system management, and by the start of the
Fall they were able to stand up a diskless cluster with
[xCAT](https://xcat.org/). In November the team traveled to Denver for SC19 and
competed against teams from around the world. I was extremely lucky to have been
able to work with such a talented and motivated group of students, and I'm very
thankful I had the opportunity to do a small amount to help further their
education.
