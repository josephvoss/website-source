Hi, my name is Joseph. I'm a Site Reliability Engineer at Cloudflare,
with a background in mechanical engineering and high performance computing. I'm
an engineer through and through, and will use whatever tool I think is
necessary to solve a problem, whether it be a wrench or a keyboard. If you're
interested in some of the projects I've done in my spare time, click the
Projects tab above. If you'd like to contact me, please use one of the links
above or email me at [jvoss@josephvoss.com](mailto:jvoss@josephvoss.com).
