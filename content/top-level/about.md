Hi, my name is Joseph. I'm a HPC Systems Engineer at Oak Ridge National Labs
with a background in mechanical engineering. I'm an engineer through and
through, and will use whatever tool I think is necessary to solve a problem,
whether it be a wrench or a keyboard. If you're interested in some of the
projects I've done in my spare time, click the Projects tab above. If you'd like
to contact me, please use one of the links above or email me at
